# Question 1

## Part A

Here, we have a data matrix $Y$ with a dimension of $n \times 3$ which has a mean of 0.

For a vector $Y$ which has been demeaned, the sample covariance matrix $S$ can be obtained through the following computation.

$$S = \dfrac{1}{n-1}(Y^TY)$$ {#eq-covmat}


To maintain matrix conformability, the dimension of $S$ will be a __$3 \times 3$__ matrix.

In order to define the covariance matric $S$ as defined by @eq-covmat, we require the following quanities:

1. A data matrix $Y$ with a mean of 0.
2. The total number of observations $n$ which is given by the number of rows in $Y$.


## Part B

An Eigen Value problem is linear in nature and defined by @eq-eigen.

$$SW = \lambda W$$ {#eq-eigen}

Where,

$S = \text{Covariance Matrix}$ \
$W = \text{Eigen Vector}$ \
$\lambda = \text{Eigen Value}$ \

As the Eigen Vector is a column vector, hence, to satisfy matrix conformability in @eq-eigen, the dimension of $W$ must be a __$3 \times 1$__ vector.


## Part C

We are given the linear combination as stated through @eq-lineareq. 

$$X = \beta Y$$ {#eq-lineareq}
We know that Y is a $n \times 1$ vector and $\beta$ is stated as a $3 \times 1$ vector. To obtain the Variance-Covariance matrix, we perform the following computations.

$$\text{Var}(X) = \text{Var}(Y\beta)$$

$$\implies \text{Var}(X) =\sum_{i=1}^{n} \dfrac{(Y_i \beta)^2}{n-1}$$
$$\implies \text{Var}(X) = \beta^T \Bigl[ \sum_{i=1}^{n}\dfrac{(Y_i)^2}  {n-1}\Bigl] \beta$$

For a data matrix $Y_i$ with mean = 0, the term $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\dfrac{(Y_i)^2}  {n-1}$ is considered as the covariance and is denoted by $S$.

$$\boxed{\implies \text{Var}(X) = \beta^T S \beta}$$ {#eq-varcovcompute}


@eq-varcovcompute provides us with the final form of the variance-covariance matrix.

We know, the dimension of $\beta^T$ is $1 \times 3$ and that of $beta$ is $3 \times 1$. In order to maintain matrix conformability, the value dimension of the variance covariance matrix $\text{Var}(X)$ will be $1 \times 1$. This suggests that the __resultant matrix is a scalar value.__
